## Hi, I’m Ksenia 🍌 
**A software developer who builds frontend 👩🏻‍💻**

I build web apps with **React, Vue, Next and Nuxt**,  
and poke **Python** on the backend when nobody is looking ✌️

## Quick facts
- Based in Finland
- Studying ICT
- Speak Russian, English and some Finnish

## What I do
- Turn any requirements into interfaces that make sense
- Make tricky UI logic behave
- Keep code clean enough so future me won't come to haunt present me

## Tech
React · Vue · Next · Nuxt · TypeScript

Python enough to get into trouble

React Native and Capacitor because mobile had to happen someday

Git, Linux, Vite, Webpack, and any other tool that screams loudest 

## Portfolio
My strongest projects are on a corporate GitLab and under NDA, but I keep a few of my favourite public ones here:
